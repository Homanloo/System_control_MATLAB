# Chemical Reactors Control and Controller Design

In this project, a number of variables such as temperature, pressure, and concentration are controlled and carefully observed in a system comprised of 2 chemical reactors in series, where the output of reactor 1 is then fed to the second reactor.
Moreover, a controller is designed by using the Zigler-Nichols method.
Finally, the system is studied in two different conrolling modes: Servo and Regulatory.

This project is done as the final project of the <b>CHEMICAL PROCESS CONTROL</b> course instructed by <b>Prof. Bozorgmehri</b>.

A report file is also available (in persian).
